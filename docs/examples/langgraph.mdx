description: "Build a minimal agent workflow using LangGraph with a runnable Python example"
---

Use LangGraph to orchestrate multi-step, stateful agent workflows. This example shows a minimal graph that takes an input message, adds an automated response node, and returns the result.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

## Minimal example (Python)

```python main.py
from typing import TypedDict, List
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define the graph state structure
class ConversationState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[str]

# Node: add an automated response

def respond(state: ConversationState) -> ConversationState:
    user_last_message = state["messages"][-1] if state["messages"] else ""
    assistant_reply = f"You said: {user_last_message}. This is a response from the graph."
    return {"messages": state["messages"] + [assistant_reply]}

# Build the graph
builder = StateGraph(ConversationState)

builder.add_node("respond", respond)

# Start at the respond node and then end
builder.set_entry_point("respond")
builder.add_edge("respond", END)

# Compile into an executable app
app = builder.compile()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    initial_state: ConversationState = {"messages": ["Hello LangGraph"]}
    # Stream returns intermediate steps; iterate to observe progression
    for update in app.stream(initial_state):
        print(update)
```

### Expected output

```text
{'respond': {'messages': ['Hello LangGraph', 'You said: Hello LangGraph. This is a response from the graph.']}}
```

## How it works

- **State**: `ConversationState` holds a list of `messages` that persists through the graph.
- **Node**: `respond` reads the latest message and appends an automated reply.
- **Edges**: The flow enters `respond` and then immediately terminates (`END`).

## Next steps

- Add more nodes for tools, retrieval, or function calling.
- Branch conditionally based on state values.
- Explore persistence and memory patterns.
