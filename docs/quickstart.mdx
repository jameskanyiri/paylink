This quickstart shows you how to use the PayLink SDK directly to initiate payments without any agentic framework.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    ```python
    from paylink import PayLink

    # Initialize PayLink client (points to local M-Pesa MCP server)
    paylink_client = PayLink(base_url="http://localhost:5002/mcp")
    ```
  </Step>



  <Step title="List available tools">
    Tools are functions that the AI can use to interact with the world. They should be well documented.
    
    Run the following code to list available tools:

    In this example only one tool is available: `stk_push`.
    
    ```python
    tools = await paylink_client.list_tools()
    print([tool.name for tool in tools.tools])
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate a payment (STK Push)">
    ```python
    import json

    tool_name = "stk_push"
    payment_args = {
        "amount": "10",
        "phone_number": "254712345678",
        "account_reference": "ORDER123",
        "transaction_desc": "TestPayment"
    }

    response = await paylink_client.call_tool(tool_name, payment_args)
    result = json.loads(response.content[0].text)
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
