This quickstart shows you how to use the PayLink SDK directly to initiate payments without any agentic framework.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
    Create a `PayLink` client that points to your MCP server.
    Here we use a local M‑Pesa server at `http://localhost:5002/mcp`.
    ```python
    from paylink import PayLink

    # Initialize PayLink client (points to local M-Pesa MCP server)
    paylink_client = PayLink(base_url="http://localhost:5002/mcp")
    ```
  </Step>



  <Step title="List available tools">
    Tools are server‑exposed actions. `list_tools()` returns names and metadata
    so you can call them by name. In this quickstart, only `stk_push` is available.
    
    ```python
    tools = await paylink_client.list_tools()
    print([tool.name for tool in tools.tools])
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate a payment (STK Push)">
    STK Push prompts the customer to approve payment on their phone.
    Send the fields below, parse the JSON response, and check `status`.
    ```python
    import json

    # Prepare request
    request = {
        "amount": "10",
        "phone_number": "254712345678",
        "account_reference": "ORDER123",
        "transaction_desc": "TestPayment",
    }

    # Invoke tool and pretty‑print result
    response = await paylink_client.call_tool("stk_push", request)
    result = json.loads(response.content[0].text)
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

    # Minimal success check
    assert result.get("status") == "success", result
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Quick recap:

- SDK initialized to your MCP server
- Tools listed and how to call them
- STK Push payment initiated and response parsed
